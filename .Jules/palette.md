## 2025-02-27 - Inconsistent Form Labeling
**Learning:** Even in modern React apps using advanced state management (nuqs), basic HTML accessibility like linking `label` to `input` via `id` and `htmlFor` is often missed for text/number inputs, while checkboxes often have them (perhaps because of code snippets/examples).
**Action:** Always audit all form fields, not just complex ones, for basic label association.
